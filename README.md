Never Miss A Concert Again

52% of the US population attend a concert at least once per year, however, many miss out on their favorite acts because tickets sell out.

No Mo' Show FOMO is a web app to predict if an upcoming concert is likely to sell out. It combines features such as artist popularity, local venue, and city information, gandered from Ticketmaster, Songkick, Google Trends and Geonames APIs. An XGBoost classifier, trained with cross-validation and hyperparamter search, then predicts a likelyhood of sell-out. Never miss a concert again.
